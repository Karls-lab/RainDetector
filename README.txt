This project involves building a weather predictor that relies on weather 
data obtained from MesoWest.com. The model utilizes a transformer architecture, 
aiming to achieve a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.12 on z-score normalized data, 
considering a sequence length of 56. In simpler terms, each day in the prediction 
involves 8 data points, and the sequence length of 56 corresponds to a 7-day forecast.
